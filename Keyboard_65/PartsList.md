| Keycaps                              | 60    | I recommend a set of uniform profile keycaps or a set of keycaps compatible with the Preonic                                                               |             |                                                                                             |
| Plate Mount 2u Stabilizer            | 1     | Currently this is not compatible with PCB mount stabilizers but this can be fixed if needed                                                                |             |                                                                                             |
| (Optional) Microcontroller Sockets   | 1     | Use these if you want the ability to change out what microcontroller you use                                                                               | $4-$10      |                                                                                             |
